# WebRTC Video Recording

This project demonstrates how to record videos using WebRTC. It supports starting, stopping, pausing, resuming, and resetting recordings. The project also includes functionality for uploading videos, with support for background sync to handle unreliable internet connections, and saving video URLs to IndexedDB.

## Features

- Record video from the webcam
- Start, stop, pause, resume, and reset recordings
- Upload videos using background sync if the internet is unreliable
- Save video URLs to IndexedDB

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later) and npm installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/victorKariuki/webrtc-video-recording.git
   cd webrtc-video-recording
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setup

1. **Create necessary directories:**

   Ensure the following directories exist:
   - `public/`: For serving frontend files.
   - `uploads/`: For storing uploaded videos.
   - `docs/`: For JSDoc documentation (this will be created automatically when you generate documentation).

   Create these directories manually or run:
   ```bash
   mkdir uploads
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   The server will run on port `3000` by default. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Test the application:**

   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
   - Use the provided UI to start, stop, pause, resume, and reset video recordings.
   - Check that videos are uploaded successfully and handled correctly.

## Generating Documentation

1. **Generate documentation:**
   ```bash
   npm run docs
   ```

   This command generates documentation for all JavaScript files and places it in the `docs/` directory.

## Viewing Documentation

1. **Access documentation:**

   After generating the documentation, view it by navigating to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/docs
   ```

   This will serve the JSDoc-generated documentation at the `/docs` route.
